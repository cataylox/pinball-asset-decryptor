"""hwshim.c's node-board motor: the car john_wick_le screeched for (PAD-237).

David, 2026-09-01: "when i start a game, i continually hear car tire screeches.
I believe this is because the CarMec is supposed to move into position when
the game starts, and it is not getting the feedback that it needs."

The car is a motor the NODE BOARD runs. The game configures it (cmd 51: which
input is the stop switch at each end), sends it to an end (cmd 53 or 54) and
polls the board (cmd 52) until that end's switch reads made. Nothing moved the
switches and the reply to cmd 52 said both ends were made at once, so the game
sent the move again every ~0.9 s for ever - and every send plays the screech.

hwshim.c now plays the car: motor_note() reads the config and the moves off
the wire, motor_tick() lands the car at the end it was sent to. This compiles
those REAL functions out of hwshim.c (the text is extracted, never copied here)
with the switch write and the clock stubbed, and feeds them the frames
john_wick_le 1.01.0 actually sent (rig 2 trace, 2026-09-27). What is worth
failing on:

  * WHICH END IS WHICH. cmd 53 must stop on the config's FIRST switch (CAR
    MOTOR HOME, input 4) and cmd 54 on the SECOND (CAR MOTOR AWAY, input 3).
    Measured on the rig: a reply showing HOME made ended the 53 retries and
    AWAY made the 54 ones. Swapped, the car goes to the wrong end and the game
    retries exactly as before.
  * THE END IT LEAVES OPENS AT ONCE, the end it is sent to closes only after
    the travel time. A car at both ends at once is the state that caused this.
  * A RE-SEND WHILE TRAVELLING IS NOT A NEW MOVE. The game repeats the command
    while the car has not arrived; restarting the clock on each would mean it
    never arrives if the travel time were ever longer than the repeat.
  * PAD_NB_MOTOR=0 moves nothing, which is the comparison run's switch.

Skipped where there is no C compiler, which is most Windows checkouts; it runs
in WSL and anywhere with cc/gcc, which is where the shim is built anyway.
