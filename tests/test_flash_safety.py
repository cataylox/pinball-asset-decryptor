"""PAD-305: a Build + flash wrote a Godzilla image over a 30.8 GB SanDisk USB
stick that sat beside the 31.9 GB SD card it was meant for, then failed its
read-back with "Access is denied ... progress.json".

1. the card is found by WHAT IS ON IT (a Stern boot partition: zImage + a
   stern-*.dtb), not by a model name or the smallest size;
2. with more than one drive, a guess is never pre-selected for an SD card,
   and the erase question says what is on the target and warns when it is
   not a pinball card;
3. a refused rename of progress.json never stops the copy."""
