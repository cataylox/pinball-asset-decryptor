"""hwshim.c's coil-run motor: jaws_le's shark (PAD-256).

The shark is not a board motor. A plain coil output (SHARK MOTOR UP/DOWN, node
9 index 0) turns a cam one way round, and the game hands the board a coil RULE
- cmd 41, byte 30 = the input that STOPS the coil (SHARK UP-MAG SW, input 12,
or SHARK DOWN-MAG SW, input 13) - then runs it with a short cmd 40 and waits
up to 10 s for that switch. Nothing moved the switches, so from Start the rig
ran the shark 10 s of every 12.5, for ever.

hwshim.c now plays the cam: coil_motor_note() reads the rule and the run off
the wire, coil_motor_tick() closes the stop switch after the travel time. This
compiles those REAL functions out of hwshim.c (test_spike2_node_motor's
extractor - the text is never copied here) with the switch write and the clock
stubbed, and feeds them the frames jaws_le 1.02 sent (rig 2 trace,
2026-09-28). What is worth failing on:

  * THE STOP INPUT IS BYTE 30, and only on a rule with no FIRING input (byte
    26). The same title's RIGHT POP BUMPER rule carries its switch in byte 26;
    a rule with both - a switch-fired coil held until a second switch - is not
    a motor, and playing it would close a switch no ball touched.
  * THE SWITCH IT LEAVES OPENS AT ONCE, the one it runs to closes after the
    travel time. UP and DOWN made together is a shark in two places.
  * THE BOARD RE-INIT RE-SENDS THE RULE every ~0.7 s (PAD-249). A re-send is
    not a new move, and neither is a second run while the first is travelling.
  * A RULE CLEARED BEFORE ARRIVAL IS THE COIL OFF: nothing arrives.
  * PAD_COIL_MOTOR=0 moves nothing, which is the comparison run's switch.
