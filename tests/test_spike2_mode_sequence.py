"""PAD-314: a mode started by shots made in ORDER, and one ended by any shot that does not score.

- ``starts_on sequence`` + ``trigger_seq <shots>`` lines in a mode file (tools/spike2_emu/modes/sdk/mode_file.c):
  the mode starts when one player makes those shots in that order, in one ball. A shot of the sequence out
  of turn starts the player over; ``trigger_seq_reset <shots>`` names more shots that do.
- mode_project: the ``start_sequence`` / ``sequence_reset_any`` fields, ``end_shot`` as "any shot that does
  not score", their checks, and the lines ``runtime_cfg`` writes for them.

The runtime half compiles mode_file.c for the HOST against test_spike2_mode_roster.py's stub of the SDK
calls, so it runs wherever an ELF C compiler is (skips otherwise).
