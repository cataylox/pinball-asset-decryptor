# rigboard.sh - every emulator's runs on the rig board (PAD-296).  Sourced.
#
# The board is %USERPROFILE%\.pad-rig on the Windows side: the one place the
# triage dashboard, the app's window and every WSL distro can all read (see
# tools/spike2_emu/padpath.sh, "RIG SLOTS: THE BOARD").  The Spike 2 rig has
# always posted slot-N.run there; nothing else did, so a HIDDEN run of any
# other emulator played with no window and no pill anywhere - David could
# hear Beetlejuice and not find it (PAD-296).
#
# A run of emulator <emu> on its rig <n> is one line of JSON in
#
#   <emu>-<n>.run   {"emu","slot","game","title","label","distro","pid",
#                    "started","hidden","audio"}
#
# keyed by emulator AND rig because the rigs are numbered per emulator (AP
# rig 1 and Spike 2 rig 1 are two different machines).  Spike 2 keeps its own
# slot-N.run, written by its watch.sh.
#
# A detached beater touches the record every 10 s while the game's pid lives
# and removes it when the pid goes, so a run killed any way at all - its
# killgame.sh, a crash, `wsl --terminate` - stops beating; the dashboard calls
# a record stale after RUN_FRESH_S (120 s) without a beat.
#
#   rigboard_post <emu> <slot> <pid> <game> <title> <visible> <audio>
#       after the game is up; <visible>/<audio> are the run's 0/1 (its
#       --visible / --audio).  <title> is the name a person reads
#       ("Legends of Valhalla"); empty, the dashboard makes one from <game>.
#   rigboard_clear <emu> <slot>
#       from killgame.sh, so a stop clears the pill at once.
#   VISIBLE=$(rigboard_visible)
#       before the launch: whether the run's windows go on the desktop
#       (PAD-309) - what the caller said, else hidden for a labelled run.
#   AUDIO=$(rigboard_audio <visible> <audio>)
#       before the launch: a HIDDEN run never plays sound unless the person
#       asked for it in words (PAD_AUDIO_ASKED=1) - a sound nobody can find
#       the source of is the worst case (PAD-266).  Prints the 0/1 to use.
#
# Posting never fails a run: no board, no write, no word.
