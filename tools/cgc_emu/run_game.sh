#!/bin/bash
# run_game.sh [<build>] - start a Chicago Gaming WPC remake on this PC, under
# qemu-arm, on the rig's emulated hardware (cgcshim.so).  <build> is a
# folder prepare.sh made (a name under $CGC_CACHE or a path; default: the
# newest there).  Run as root; the game runs as $CGC_USER.  Returns once the
# game reached attract mode (or died).
#
# Always hidden and muted: the game draws into a file ($CGC_RIG/fb, shot.sh
# makes a picture of it) and SDL's dummy audio driver takes its sound.  A
# window and speakers are the app's Emulate tab's business (a follow-up).
#
# The machine runs /home/debian/emumm/emumm from its own folder (it opens
# ../emumm/appdata/rom/... and ./cgc.so relative to it).  Here that folder
# is $CGC_RIG/home/emumm, the build hard-linked, with the files the game
# writes linked to this slot's kept copies in $CGC_NV (the FRAM, CGC's
# adjustments samadj.bin, the clock offset); CGC_FRESH=1 starts over.  The
# game logs to /tmp/z4.log, so it gets a private /tmp ($CGC_RIG/tmp).
#
# A fresh FRAM makes the Williams ROM restore factory settings and wait for
# the operator; run_game.sh presses ENTER, then ESCAPE until attract, as an
# operator would, until a run of this slot and title has reached attract
# once ($CGC_NV/.attract).
# Switches: sw.py.  Picture: shot.sh.  Stop: killgame.sh.
