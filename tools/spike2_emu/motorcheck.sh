# motorcheck.sh <key> <card> - boot, start a game, count a board motor's moves.
#
# The rigbatch job PAD-237 was proven with (bootcheck.sh is the template it
# follows): boot to attract in THIS rig slot (PAD_SLOT), latch the switches
# MOTOR_HOLD names ("77:1 84:0" - id:level), start a game with plunge.py, and
# count what node MOTOR_NODE (default 9) was sent for MOTOR_SAMPLE seconds
# (default 40) after Start. The last line is
#
#   VERDICT <key> pass c53=<n> c54=<n> c40=<n> [env...]
#
# c53/c54 are the motor's move commands - the count that was 35/31 while
# nothing answered john_wick_le's car and every send was a tyre screech, and
# is 0 now. c40 is coil fires on the same node and c40i the same split by coil
# index - on john_wick_le 06/08 are the drop target's TRIP/RESET, 139 in 40 s
# with nothing answering it and 2 with the feeder's model (PAD-248,
# docs/plans/node_board_motor.md). It always passes
# when the run starts; the counts are the result. Knobs the sweeps varied
# (PAD_NB_CREPLY, PAD_NB_CFILL, PAD_NB_MOTOR, PAD_MOTOR_MS) are passed in the
# list's ENV and echoed on the verdict line so a results.tsv reads alone.
