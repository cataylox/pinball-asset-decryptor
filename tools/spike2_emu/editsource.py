"""editsource.py - a multi-boot image given as a BASE CARD PLUS AN EDITS FOLDER (PAD-241).

A jukebox card's members are one title with its songs changed.  The card side stores them
compactly (item 95's store, item 107's deltas), but the INPUT was always a whole card image
per member: forty song sets meant forty 8 GB .raw files on the PC to feed a card that holds
them in a few GB.  The app already writes the lighter form - an OVERRIDE SET, the card files
the edits touch, whole, beside overrides.json naming the card they were edited from
(plugins/stern/engine.py write_overrides, what Emulate binds over a card to run the edits).

A member source spelled

    <base.raw>+<edits folder>

is that card with those files in place of its own: the same games tree the full build of the
same edits would carry (write_image and write_overrides share _compute_patches, byte for
byte), read without it ever existing.  mkmulticard takes it anywhere it takes an extra image
(--extra, --member, --members-list, verify's list); the store layout is the only one it can
land in, since the others copy a partition verbatim and there is no partition to copy.

WHAT IS REFUSED, and why each one is refused rather than guessed:
  - a folder with no overrides.json, or one still being built (a half set is not a set);
  - a set from a NEWER app (OVERRIDE_VERSION above ours): its shape is not one this reads;
    one from an older app is refused too - Try it again rebuilds it in the current shape;
  - a set edited from a DIFFERENT card than the base given (size + mtime, the identity the
    set itself records and the rig's card cache keys on): its files are patched copies of
    another card's, and laid over this one they are a corrupt title;
  - a set made to run over another card (PAD-172's run_card): its game program carries THAT
    card's build, which no full build of these edits from this base would;
  - a set that carries custom modes (item 149): their files live on the system partition,
    beside the set rather than in it, and a member's system partition is never read;
  - a set whose files are not as its manifest left them (size + mtime): what the folder holds
    is then not what any build wrote.

The overlay is BY INODE: an edited file's bytes replace the base inode's, exactly what the
build's in-place patch does to the card - so a file the base hardlinks under two names is
edited under both, as it would be on a built card.
