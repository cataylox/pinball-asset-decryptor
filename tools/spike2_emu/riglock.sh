#   riglock.sh take --any <who> [what...]       first free slot >= 1; prints slot=N
#   riglock.sh take --slot N <who> [what...]    that slot or nothing

#                                               if free or lapsed, refuse if it is
#                                               someone else's and in use
#   riglock.sh note N <what...>                 say what you are doing now
#   riglock.sh release N [<who>]                give it back (refused while a run is up)
#   riglock.sh list [--json]                    every slot: holder, doing, age, run

#
# A LOCK IS A LEASE, HELD ONLY WHILE THE RIG IS IN USE (David, 2026-09-27: "it
# only locks when it is ACTIVELY using it"). A held slot is RUNNING while a run
# is up in it, ACTIVE for PAD_LOCK_IDLE seconds (default 300) after its holder
# last used it - a run ending, a rig command, a note - and LAPSED after that.
# A lapsed slot is free to anyone: `take` seizes it (free slots first), and
# the holder's own next rig command takes it straight back if nobody did
# (watch.sh, killgame.sh and restorestate.sh call `use` before they act - see
# pad_slot_use in padpath.sh). So a session never has to remember to release,
# and a ticket that was merged, or a window that was killed, holds nothing
# five minutes later.
#
# <who> names the holder the way every window of its run will: the item branch
# (item/48), the triage ticket (PAD-231) or the feature branch. <what> is a few
# words for what is UP right now - "godzilla run", "build", "app" - because
# that is what the next session and David's dashboard need to read.
#
# RUN IT AS ROOT TO TAKE A SLOT >= 1 (`wsl -u root -e bash riglock.sh take
# ...`): taking the slot also mounts its rootfs, which is an overlay and needs
# root (see padpath.sh, "RIG SLOTS"). As the plain user it still takes the
# lock and prints the one line that mounts the slot.
#
# THE RECORDS ARE ON THE WINDOWS SIDE (%USERPROFILE%\.pad-rig\slot-N.lock) so
# the app, the triage dashboard and a rig in any WSL distro all read the same
# ones - see pad_board_dir. Creation is `set -C` (O_EXCL), atomic on drvfs as
# on ext4: two sessions racing for one slot get one winner and one refusal.
#
# SLOT 0 IS THE ORDINARY RIG (~/spike2root), and the pre-slot lock file
# /home/<user>/.pad_rig_lock still means "slot 0 is held". Sessions that
# predate slots only know that file, so a slot 0 take writes both and a slot
# 0 listing reads both.
