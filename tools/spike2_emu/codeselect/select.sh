#!/bin/sh
# select.sh - the codeselect hook for /etc/init.d/game on a multi-image card.
#
# Called right after the script's own 'pkill boot_display ' line and before
# 'if [ -f $GAMES_PATH/game ]; then'. Runs the selector, reads the index it
# wrote, looks the device up in images.conf and, unless it is image 0 (the
# primary, which fstab already mounted at /games), swaps the mount. Stern's
# own launch lines follow untouched.
#
# Device forms in images.conf:
#   <dev>         a whole games partition: umount /games; mount -o ro,relatime,exec <dev> /games
#   <dev>:<sub>   a partition holding several games trees (img1/, img2/ ...):
#                 umount /games; mount -o ro <dev> /mnt/multi; mount --bind /mnt/multi/<sub> /games
#                 (/mnt/multi is created when the rootfs allows it; on the
#                 stock read-only rootfs /var/volatile/multi (tmpfs) is used)
#
# Every failure boots the primary (/dev/mmcblk0p3 is mounted back on /games):
# the card degrades to a stock card, never to a brick. This script never
# touches /mnt/boot. Writing the last-choice file is the selector's job.
#
# THE CARD LOG IS OFF unless images.conf carries a `log=<path>` line
# (mkmulticard.py --debug-log writes log=/dump/log/codeselect.log): a card
# the app builds writes nothing to /dump, boot after boot. The selector's
# stderr (the same lines) still reaches the serial console. With a log= line
# the selector starts the file afresh each boot (the previous boot's is kept
# as <path>.1) and writes at most 1 MiB, and this script's own lines go there
# too. CODESELECT_LOG=<path> forces a log, CODESELECT_LOG= (empty) none.
#
# AN IMAGE WITH ITS OWN HIGH SCORES (PAD-226): a `scores=<N>|<name>` line gives
# image N a machine store of its own. The game keeps its settings, audits and
# high-score table under /data/nv/<title>, and /data is one partition every
# image on the card shares, so two images of the same title share one table -
# wrong when one of them carries custom modes that change the scoring. After
# image N is mounted, /data/nv.own/<name>/<title> is bound over
# /data/nv/<title>; the first boot seeds it with a copy of the shared store
# (settings carry over; the owner resets its high scores once on the machine).
# Each image without a line keeps sharing. Every failure here leaves the image
# on the shared store and the boot goes on.
#
# EACH IMAGE'S OWN CUSTOM MODES (PAD-226): a card's modes live on the rootfs at
# /usr/local/padmode, and a multi-boot card has only the primary's rootfs. The
# build copies every other image's set to $DIR/modes/img<N>/ (and makes an empty
# $DIR/modes/none); once image N is mounted its set - or the empty one - is bound
# over /usr/local/padmode, so the hooked game_monitor preloads the booted image's
# modes and nobody else's. Image 0 keeps the set its own card put there. A card
# with no $DIR/modes is left exactly as it always was.
#
# THE COLOR CORRECTION SET ON THIS MACHINE (PAD-307): the menu's Settings >
# Color correction keeps the operator's numbers per image in $COLOR (on /data).
# Once image N is mounted, and only when the conf says its game can be adjusted
# (a color_profile= line) and $COLOR holds numbers for it that differ from the
# build's, the selector writes a copy of the game program with those numbers in
# its drawing shaders into RAM ($COLOR_DIR, on the /var/volatile tmpfs) and the
# copy is bound over <title>/game. The games partition is never written. Every
# failure leaves the program as it was built: the colours it was built with,
# never a machine that will not boot.
#
#   select.sh                     the hook (what /etc/init.d/game calls)
#   select.sh --lookup N [conf]   print image N's device (without :<sub>)
#   select.sh --lookup-sub N [conf]   print image N's subdirectory ("" when none)
#   select.sh --scores N [conf]   print image N's own-scores name ("" when it shares)
#
# POSIX sh; needs only busybox sed/awk/grep/head/tr/mkdir/mount/umount + pidof.
# The CODESELECT_* variables exist for the tests (a fake selector, fake
# mount/umount, no block-device check); the hook runs with the defaults.
