"""Emulate tab for Dutch Pinball - the Tk-free facts of the rig in
``tools/dp_emu`` (the tab itself is ``webui/tabs/emulate_dp.py``).

Two games, two programs.  The Big Lebowski is an x86-64 Linux program on
Dutch Pinball's own P-ROC framework, and it ships its own simulator: started
with ``fakepinproc`` it drives no hardware, so the rig gives it only what the
machine's disk gave it (base assets, the installed version), a window, sound
and a key for every switch.  Alice's Adventures in Wonderland is a native
C++ program with no simulator; the rig runs it in a chroot of its own root
and answers it as its P-ROC (tools/dp_emu/aaiw).  See tools/dp_emu/README.md.

The tab takes the machine's DISK IMAGE (the base assets exist nowhere else)
and, for The Big Lebowski, optionally an update .zip laid over it - the
factory's, or one the Write tab built - so a mod can be played before it
goes on a USB stick.

Everything that knows the rig's layout lives here, as the BoF tab's does in
``emulate_bof_core``; how a script is invoked and how status is parsed is
``webui/rig.py``'s, shared by every rig.
