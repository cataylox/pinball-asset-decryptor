"""Emulate tab for American Pinball - the Tk-free facts of the rig in
``tools/ap_emu`` (the tab itself is ``webui/tabs/emulate_ap.py``).

AP's games are SkeletonGame (PyProcGameHD) Python programs with the
framework's own simulator built in (FakePinPROC), so there is no CPU to
emulate and no licence check: the rig supplies what the machine's OS did -
Python 2.7 (3.14 for Galactic Tank Force's 2026 build) and its libraries,
built once by ``setup.sh`` inside the app's Linux, a machine at rest (a full
trough, the coin door shut), a window, sound, and a way to press every
switch.  Hot Wheels and Galactic Tank Force draw through AP's own ``apiav``,
which the rig starts too.  See tools/ap_emu/README.md.

The tab takes the game-code ``.pkg`` - the file the machine installs, or one
the Write tab built - so a mod can be played before it goes on a USB stick.
The rig decrypts it with the AP plugin's key into a cache inside the app's
Linux; the ``.pkg`` is only ever read.

Everything that knows the rig's layout lives here, as the BoF tab's does in
``emulate_bof_core``; how a script is invoked and how status is parsed is
``webui/rig.py``'s, shared by every rig.
