"""Install a Mac's missing host tools with the package manager it has.

Install Missing on the prerequisites strip used to be hidden on macOS, and
the gear menu's entry showed a box that said ``brew install gnupg ffmpeg``
and left the typing to the user.  A Mac that is handed a command to type is
being asked to do the app's job (David, 2026-08-19, on the Emulate tab's
"Set up emulator…"), so this does the work itself: the missing rows that
name a Mac package (:attr:`..core.prereqs.Prerequisite.mac_pkg`) become one
``brew install`` / ``port install`` run in the app's own log.

CHOSEN BY WHAT IS ALREADY ON THIS MAC.  Homebrew first because it never
runs as root and needs no password; MacPorts when that is what the machine
has (it installs system-wide, so macOS asks for the password once, in its
own dialog).  Neither is installed for the user here - without one there is
no plan, and the caller keeps its advice box.

The first Mac that needed this was cooltoy's, on Barrels of Fun (PAD-220):
gpg missing, the strip green, the Extract Failed box blaming the .fun file.

A MACPORTS THAT WILL NOT RUN IS FOUND OUT BEFORE THE PASSWORD.  The same
Mac came back the next day (PAD-221): its MacPorts had been installed for
macOS 15 and the Mac had since moved to macOS 26, so ``port`` refused every
command with "OS platform mismatch ... Please run 'sudo port migrate'".
The app asked for the password first and then only wrote MacPorts' refusal
to the log, which read as "it errors and does nothing".  Now
:func:`macports_health` runs ``port version`` (no password) before any plan
is shown; a MacPorts that needs migrating gets the migration as the first
consent step and the first command of the same one-password run, and a
MacPorts that is broken some other way blocks the plan with its own words
in a box instead of a password dialog.
