"""Which Spike 2 emulator rig this app drives, and who holds the others.

The rig side is ``tools/spike2_emu/padpath.sh`` ("RIG SLOTS") and
``riglock.sh``; the design is ``docs/plans/rig_slots.md``. In one paragraph:
a PC can run several emulator rigs at once, one per session. Rig 0 is the
ordinary one and what every installed copy of the app uses; rig N >= 1 is a
complete rig of its own, selected by ``PAD_SLOT=N`` in the environment of every
rig command. Who holds which rig is written to a BOARD on the Windows side
(``%USERPROFILE%\\.pad-rig``), one JSON line per file:

    slot-N.lock   {"slot","who","what","distro","user","taken"}
    slot-N.run    {"slot","game","label","distro","root","pid","started"},
                  touched every ~10 s while the run lives

This module is the app's half: the environment its rig commands carry, the
board as the Emulate tab shows it, and the rig an app launched from a triage
ticket claims for itself so that two ticket apps never share one.

NOTHING HERE CHANGES AN ORDINARY INSTALL. With no PAD_SLOT, PAD_LABEL or
PAD_TICKET in the environment, rig_env() is empty and the app drives rig 0
exactly as before; the board is only read, and an absent board reads as five
free rigs.
